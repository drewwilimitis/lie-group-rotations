### Relevant concepts I explore include:
- Skew-symmetric matrix manifolds
- Lie group theory
- Matrix exponential-based gradient updates in a Riemannian optimization approach
- The applications to learning rotations

I attempt to implement the following **Algorithm 1** in Python - as originally proposed in **[1]**:
